# BrainiacChess-Demo

## Description
This is the demo of my efforts in the Project BrainiacChess Dev Team. I participated in this project since February and things are under great pace of development. The project is not ready to be shipped yet, but presentable.

## Features
* Chess AI system using MiniMax Algorithm and Alpha-Beta Pruning
* Different levels of chess AI
* Multiplayer system with online ranking
* Two different views 2D and 3D 

## Challenges
* This is the first time I worked in a big team with an agile mindset. It was hard at first to catch up with the codes, but it didn't take long for me to understand about chess board manager scripts and pieces controls. 
* Another challenge I received recently was building the chess AI for the game, which is a very challenging task as it came with another mission to make the design easier or harder. Fortunately, the resourcefulness of different websites have helped me through and gave me the ideas to use MiniMax Algorithm and Alpha-Beta Pruning. 
* One recent challenge but fun was researching the details on how to use Coroutine Properly with Actions input as reference with Unity. I usually used Coroutines as a mean to stop actions for few seconds, but this time, I applied it to split the calculation for chess AI into different frames in order not to crunch all the calculations and freezed the game.

## Major Components
* Unity
* Minimax Algorithm

## Innovation
Chess AI difficulty scale will be modified and the penalty points for each move for chess will be added so that the AI will make more efficient moves.
